## 📊 Customer Churn & Retention Analysis

**SQL | Python | Statistics | Excel | Tableau**

### 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn to identify **who is churning, why they are churning, and what actions can reduce churn**.
The analysis combines **SQL, Python, statistical validation, Excel-based analysis, and Tableau dashboards** to deliver actionable business insights.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

* Identify key churn drivers
* Quantify churn risk across customer segments
* Provide data-backed retention recommendations

---

## 📂 Data Overview

Three relational datasets were used:

* **customers.csv** → demographics, tenure, contract type, churn flag
* **billing.csv** → pricing and payment behavior
* **usage.csv** → service usage and support interactions

📌 Dataset size: ~6,000 customers

---

## 📊 Excel Analysis

Excel was used for:

* Pivot-table based churn validation
* Tenure bucket analysis (0–6, 6–12, 12+ months)
* Quick business-facing summaries

📄 See: `/excel/churn_pivot_analysis.xlsx`

---

## 🐍 Python Analysis & Statistics

Python was used for:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature-level churn analysis
* Hypothesis testing to validate churn drivers

Statistical tests applied:

* Two-sample t-test (monthly charges vs churn)
* Mann–Whitney U test (tenure vs churn)

 
---

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard was built to communicate insights to stakeholders.

### Dashboard Components:

* KPI tiles (overall churn, high-risk churn, pricing)
* Churn by contract type
* Monthly charges vs churn
* Tenure bucket × churn heatmap

📄 See: `/tableau/churn_dashboard.twbx`

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Early-tenure customers churn the most
* Month-to-Month contracts are the strongest churn driver
* Higher pricing and frequent support issues increase churn risk
* Churn is driven by structural factors, not randomness

---

## ✅ Recommendations

* Strengthen early-tenure retention programs
* Encourage upgrades to longer-term contracts
* Proactively engage customers with frequent support interactions
* Use churn risk indicators for targeted retention efforts

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

* SQL (joins, cohorts, aggregations)
* Python (Pandas, SciPy, EDA, statistics)
* Excel (pivot tables, validation analysis)
* Tableau (dashboard design, storytelling)
* Business insight generation & recommendations

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end analytics workflow**, from raw data to stakeholder-ready insights, using tools commonly required in Data Analyst and Junior Data Scientist roles.
